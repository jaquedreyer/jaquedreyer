# Hi, I'm Jaque Dreyer! 

### A PhD Research Scientist in career transition to Tech 

Iâ€™m a highly adaptive professional, motivated by curiosity and a genuine passion for continuous learning.
This is my first venture into programming, and every day I'm learning something new. 
I love working in a team and helping others as I can.
Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Unisinos.
Please feel free to connect with me and contribute to my projects. I would be happy to meet you more!
